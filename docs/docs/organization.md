# Code organization in RepLAB

## Directories

- `docs`: compiled documentation ready to be served by Jekyll,
- `docs_src`: source files for the executable documentation, to be compiled by `replab_compiledoc.m`,
- `external`: external libraries, either included as a Git submodule (if available on a public repository such as Github), or vendored (like `vpi`),
- `+replab`: the main RepLAB package, containing the main classes/methods,
- `+replab/+subpackages`: implementation files for different submodules,
- `tests`: tests written using MOxUnit, augmented with our laws test framework.

## The `Class`, `ClassFun` and `ClassLaws` triad

This works for `Class` = `Domain`, `Class` = `Semigroup`, `Class` = `Action`, and so on.

There, `Class` is an abstract base class, while `ClassFun` requires function handles that implement the abstract methods of `Class` as parameters to its constructor. This enables the creation of "anonymous" classes in the spirit of MATLAB's "anonymous" functions.

The `ClassLaws` class lists the algebraic laws that should be obeyed by a particular structure.

- `Laws`: abstract base class for the laws checking framework.

## Structured sets

Most classes in RepLAB describe sets of elements with additional structure.

### Domains

At the base of the hierarchy, the `Domain` describes a set of elements that can be tested for equality (`eqv`) and from which random samples can be taken (`sample`). Such sets are potentially infinite.

As `Domain` is an abstract base class, it contains abstract methods (`eqv`, `sample`).

To quickly create an instance of `Domain`, the helper class `DomainFun` can be used, passing the method implementations as function handles to the `DomainFun` constructor.

### Blackbox groups

The following three classes provide basic group structures.

- `Semigroup`: structure with associative binary operation
- `Monoid`: + an identity element (property), and test for identity
- `Group`: + inverse elements

### Finitely generated groups

All elements of finitely generated groups can be obtained by composition of a finite number of the group generators; and the set of those generators is also finite.

In particular, such groups enable the factorization of their elements into words.

- `FinitelyGeneratedGroup`: abstract base class for finitely generated groups,
- `FreeGroup`: the free group on `n` generators,
- `Word`: class describing elements of `FreeGroup`.

### Finite groups

Finite groups contain a finite number of elements.

- `FiniteGroup`: abstract base class for finite groups,
- `SignedPermutationGroup`: provides an abstract base class for all signed permutation groups,
- `SignedPermutations`: describes the signed permutations on $\{-n,...,-1, 1,...,n\}$,
- `SignedPermutationSubgroup`: describes a group generated by signed permutations.

- `FiniteGroupDecomposition`: describes the decomposition of a group into a product of sets.

### Abstract group constructions

- `DirectProductGroup`: represents the (outer) direct product of finite groups, the elements are represented by row cell arrays,
- `SemidirectProductGroup`: represents an outer semidirect product from a homomorphism, with both factors finite groups,
- `WreathProductGroup`: describes the wreath product of a finite group by a permutation group.

### Permutation groups

Permutation groups are finite groups that are subgroups of the symmetric group acting on `n` elements.

In particular, the decomposition of $\{1,...,n\}$ into orbits, the natural action and representation of the group are all defined.

- `PermutationGroup`: abstract base class for permutation groups,
- `Permutations`: describes the symmetric group acting on `n` points.

### Actions

The following two classes in RepLAB do not define a domain, but rather express a relation between domains.

- `Action`: abstract base class that defines the action of elements of a group `G` on elements of a domain `P`,
- `FaithfulAction`: in addition, for any `g` in `G` which is not the identity, the class provides a `p` in `P` that is moved by `g`.

### BSGS groups

Base and strong generating set structures enable powerful algorithms to study finite groups.

Those algorithms are generic and rest on the availability of a `FaithfulAction` for the group.

- `BSGSGroup`: generic implementation of BSGS algorithms,
- `perm.PermutationBSGSGroup`: implementation for permutation groups.

### Representations

- `Rep` is a real or complex representation of a finitely generated group. 

- `RepByImages` is a real or complex representation described by the (matrix) images of the group generators; the computation of images rests on the factorization of group elements.

Once a `Rep` has been constructed, it can be decomposed into irreducible representations using the `realRep.decomposition` method.

- `SubRep` describes a subrepresentation of an existing representation. The instance can remember which representation it splits (as a `parent`) and the change of basis matrix (`U`).
- `Irrep` describes an irreducible subrepresentation; for representations over the reals, it also takes care to express the complex/quaternion division algebras in a regular manner.
- `Isotypic` are isotypic components, which group equivalent irreducible representations present in a reprsentation.
- `Irreducible` regroups isotypic components.

### Commutant algebras

The key to the simplification of invariant semidefinite programs is the decomposition of *matrices that commute with a group representation*; the set of all such matrices is the *commutant algebra*.

RepLAB has several classes to work with centralizer algebras.

- `Equivariant` describes the vector space of equivariant linear maps between two representations of the same group.
- `Commutant` describes a generic commutant algebra.
- `DivisionAlgebra` describes a division algebra present in an irreducible representation.

## Sequences of elements

- `Enumerator`: describes an indexed sequence, whose index is a big integer (`vpi`).

## Utility classes

- `Partition`: describes an unordered partition of the integers $\{1,...,n\}$,
- `DivisionAlgebra`: generic representation of the real, complex and quaternionic algebras over the reals,
- `rational`: a hacky implementation of rational matrices with double-representable integer coefficients,
- `Quaternion`: a minimal implementation of quaternion matrices,
- `Settings`: various global settings such as tolerances,
- `GroupMorphismLaws`: laws for function handles that are group homomorphisms.

## Methods

- `isNonZeroMatrix`, tests whether a matrix is nonzero up to a given tolerance using the 2-norm (singular value), with accelerations provided by matrix norm inequalities and cheap norms,
- `headerStr`: returns a short description of an object without digging into its contents, 
- `shortStr`: returns a short description of an object, with a best effort to include its contents,
- `longStr`: returns a long description of an object, including an enumeration of its properties.
