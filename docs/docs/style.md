# Style guide

We describe guiding principles used in the code.

## Capitalization

CamelCase/camelCase follows the separations of US English; words separated either by a hyphen or a space are separated in the camel case.
Class names are `UpperCamelCase`.
Method and function names are `lowerCamelCase`.

## Object creation

When there is only one implementation of an interface, the constructor is public and can be called directly.

Example: `S4 = replab.Permutations(4)`

When a base interface is available and several optimized implementations are available, the object should be constructed by calling a function with the same name as the base interface, in `lowerCamelCase`.

Example: `c = replab.equivariant(rep1, rep2)`

That function will then construct the object with the best performance characteristics.

## No abstract methods in abstract base classes

As Octave does not support the `methods (Abstract)` syntax, we provide generic implementations for abstract methods in abstract base classes by either:

- trying to retrieve and calling a function handle property (the `DomainFun`, `SemigroupFun`, ... approach), or
- throwing `error('Not implemented')`.
